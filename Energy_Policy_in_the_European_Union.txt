\chapter{Introduction}


The European Union (EU) started out originally in 1951 as the
\textsl{European Coal and Steel Community}\footnote{The \emph{European Coal and
Steel Community} was founded by the Treaty of Paris on April 18th, 1951 and
entered into force on July 23rd, 1952} in an effort tp jointly manage
the strategic goods and energy. In the following decades though, the area of
energy policy remained largely the preserve of its member states though, not
even the oil crises of 1967 and 1973 induced any major shift towards integrating
energy policy thus making binding decisions on the European
level\footnote{Haghighi (2008), p.467}. Only with the publication of the first
Green Book on energy by the European Commission in 2000\footnote{see European
Commission (2000)} did the EU\footnote{Although strictly speaking this paper
will the pillar \emph{European Community} as its core subject, I will refer to
it as the European Union (EU). Regarding daily usage in the media readers will
be more familiar with this term, even though it is somewhat incorrect.}
forcefully express its desire to become active in this field. Subsequent
papers and statements issued by the Commission as well the European Parliament
reaffirmed this demand for increased competences for Union institutions.\par

This lag in the integration process in the area of energy compared to other
policy fields contrasts markedly with the general development of the European
Community. The \emph{Functionalist} approach to international relations had
predicted that due to so-called 'spill-over effects' energ both essential for
warfarey policy should become more Europeanized since the consequences of the
common market would require a common energy policy, distinct national strategies
rendered unsuitable to an ever more integrated Europe\footnote{see Haas (1958),
(1964) as well as Lindberg \& Scheingold (1970)}. Until the 2000s there was no
European energy policy to speak of, although the internal market with its
provisions for the free movement of goods, labor, capital and services had been
established by the Treaty of Maastricht already back in 1992. The ensuing
'spill-over effects' should then have prodded national governments to delegate
powers to supranational institutions to better cope with Europe-wide issues
relating to energy.\par


The \emph{Functionalists}' perspective can be questioned by energy's
essential role for modern, industrialized economies. Put simply without
sufficient energy supplies Europe's economies will quickly grind to a halt, as
they are highly dependent on imports primary
energy\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{\textsl{The term 'primary energy'
describes an energy form found in nature which has not run through any
conversion or transformation process. It is contained in raw fuels, like crude
oil, natural gas, uranium and other forms of energy, e.g. wind, solar power
received as input to a system.}}} notably fossil fuels\footnote{see Eurostat
2012}. Not only have large amounts of oil to be purchased from foreign suppliers
due to a lack of domestic reserves, but the same holds for natural gas, which is
used for heating and electricity generation. Being key to economic development
and national security energy policy fits neatly into \emph{Neo-Realist}
explanations of international politics. Following \emph{Neo-Realism}'s arguments
states should consider energy supply as a vital interest not to be left to
supranational organisations like the European Union. Rather member states would
keep energy policy firmly under their authority and delegate as little power as
possible.\par

Up to mid-2000s energy policy in Europe could be explained quite well from such
a \emph{Neo-Realist} perspective with national governments preserving their
prerogatives as assertively as in the field of foreign policy itself. Then came
along the recurring disputes between Russia, Europe's main supplier of natural
gas on the one side, and on the other the main transit country for
these gas deliveries, Ukraine. From winter 2005 on both parties bickered
repeatedly about the price to be paid for natural gas and Russia's state-owned
gas company \textsl{Gazprom}\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{\textsl{This
paper will assume that the interests of Gazprom and the Russian state are
basically identical (the Russian state being the largest share-holder of the
company and its chief executive appointed by the Kremlin), or at least overlap
to such a degree regarding the export strategy for natural gas, that for the
anaylsis presented here no distinction will be made. For a more sophisticated
view and the correctness of this assumption please see}}
\textcolor{red}{CITATION NEEDED!!!!}} interrupted deliveries or threatened to do
so\footnote{The Telegraph (2008), Chicago Tribune (2009)}.\par

For the first time some of the old member states were affected by supply
disruptions, even if less so than the new members from Central \& Eastern
Europe. As the disputes over gas became a rather permanent feature in
Ukrainian-Russian relations the European Commission drew member states'
attention to the fact the Europe's dependence on foreign supplies would grow in
the coming decades and that deliveries could not be considered as reliable as
had been assumed so far\footnote{see European Commission (2007a)}. In the Treaty
of Lisbon national governments agreed to shift some powers in the area of energy
policy to the European Commission and the European Parliament. The Commission
has expressly been given the authority to represent the Union in energy
questions in international negotiations\footnote{Braun (2011), p.8 \&
\emph{Treaty on the European Union} (hereinafter TEU) art.17}.\par

\chapter{Research Question \& Structure Of The Paper}


      \paragraph{Research Question}

This paper looks for an answer to the question, whether the incremental
integration process, with multilateral cooperation in Europe evolving
from its first tentative steps after World War II to a monetary if not quite
political union, by now also includes to the area of energy policy. Put in
theoretical terms, which formal approaches to international relations (IR) and
specifically to the phenomenon of regional integrations do offer the best
explanations of this process. From the 'traditional' \emph{Neo-Realist}
perspective we should not see any or very little integration, i.e. delegation of
powers to European institutions. As energy is tightly connected to national
security concerns this school of international relations predicts that states
are anxious to hold on to as much control as possible over choices on energy mix
and strategies to ensure supply from foreign sources.\par

At the same time, the European Union has been delegated ever more powers in
other areas with member states relinquishing fundamental attributes of their
sovereignty such as monetary policy, the design of their market economies and
trade policy. This paper does not intend to provide a detailed discussion on why
governments would hand over such competences to a supranational body, even
though they would not have to from a (\emph{Neo-Realist}) national-security
standpoint\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{In fact \emph{Neo-Realism}
argues that states enter only into international agreements which enhance their
national security. Economic motives are discarded by this approach as a valid
explanation of interstate cooperation.}}. There already exists more than ample
literature on the European integration process in general and its
drivers\footnote{For a more detailed discussion of different theoretical
approaches to European integration see among others: Manners (2013), Pollack
(2001), Warleigh-Lack (2006)} for my work to offer new insights to the
discussion. Nonetheless research on the specific area of energy policy is rather
limited compared to other fields like trade, competition and environmental
regulation\footnote{Kelstrup 1998, p.18}. Here I will propose some explanations
of why the Europeanization process for energy policy is evidently different and
harder to understand by existing integration approaches.\par

As already mentioned in the introductory part players of the EU have become
noticably active in energy matters only during the latter half of the past
decade. This raises the question of why no substantial energy policy had been
developed in the decades before, but suddenly we see the topic of 'energy
security' appear on the European agenda and various actors calling for a common
approach when dealing with foreign supplier countries. Do the recent
developments in EU energy policy call for change in the theoretic approach
political science has to take when analysing this area of the integration
process? What causes can be identified for this substantial shifts in
content and structure of Europe's energy policy?\par 


This paper will suggest that the external shock of recurring disruptions in gas
supplies from Russia through Ukraine induced a policy change in the EU.
The events apparently also made old member states come to realize that their gas
provisions were vulnerable to political crises in supplier and transit countries
alike.\par 




	\paragraph{Proceeding}

First this paper briefly presents the two main approaches to explaining
European integration and describe to what extent they are able to account for
the current situation of European energy policy. To provide the reader with
background information on the present-day picture of energy affairs in Europe
the workings of natural gas markets will be presented in more detail and its
implications for the concept of 'supply security'. 'Security of natural gas
supplies' will be the subject of a third part and I will limit my research
to this form of energy, leaving other energy types aside.\par

In order to show that there indeed is a policy change over time, the repeated
disputes between Russia and Ukraine about gas deliveries shall serve as
explanatory factors for the evolution of European energy policy in the last
decade. Here we should see responses from the EU that increasingly signal a
Common energy policy rather than single-handed efforts by individual member
states when confronted with a threat of supply disruptions.\par

Drawing upon the work of J\"anicke and Gurr on crisis theory I suggest that it
was these crises that induced a substantial policy shift in Europe that had
been not possible before. Here the paper will attempt to show that member states
and EU institutions were faced with external shocks that required a response the
existing institutional setting could not provide.\par

Finally my paper will evaluate how far we can explain today's energy policy
by institutionalist arguments rather than intergovernmentalist approaches.
Modifications of primary legislation, i.e. Community treaties would be strong
indicators for a substantial shift towards decision-making on the European
level which is not temporary of nature.\par

\chapter{Explanations Of European Integration}	
	

In the endeavor to offer a theoretical framework for explaining political
developments in Europe after World War II, two schools of thought,
\emph{Neo-functionlism} and \emph{intergovernmentalism} and its later, modified
variant \emph{liberal intergovernmentalism} have markedly shaped the debate
among scholars of international relations\footnote{Obydenkova (2011), p.3}. The
phenomenon of European countries relinquishing sovereignty and delegating power
to a supranational organization which started as the \textsl{European Coal and
Steel Community} and then evolved into the \textsl{European Community} which
later became part of the \textsl{European Union}, could not be understood by the
standard approach at the time \emph{Neo-Realism}.\par


      \paragraph{Neo-Realism}

This theory of cooperation or non-cooperation among nation states sees the
international system as intrinsically anarchic and structured by the
differing capabilities states possess\footnote{Waltz (1979), p.132/133}. States,
which are the only relevant actors, value military power and resources as
determinants of their respective capabilities and judge their own position on
the international stage relative to others. Consequently they are only concerned
with mere survival, and being uncertain about the true intentions of other
countries internatinal politics is marked by general mistrust. Thus states
only enter into cooperation with other countries when this serves the purpose
of national security, i.e. they can expect gains relative to the capability of
other states. Smaller states may have no other choice than to attempt to
constraint bigger powers through international rules in order to counterbalance
their superiority\footnote{Pollack (2001), p.224}.\par


   \section{Neo-Functionalism}

Following \emph{Neo-Realism}'s view of world politics Europeans should never
have entered into any arrangement which made them give up competences to
supranational institutions that would later become the European Commission,
European Parliament and the European Court of Justice. Put differently, such a
thing as the European Union which does not serve collective defensive purposes
and thus national security is unthinkable in Neo-Realist terms and cannot be
explained.\par

\emph{Functionalism} proposed a new approach to understand the European
integration process. Its central idea was that a mismatch between the
territorial dimension of society's problems and of political authority to deal
with them induces pressures for jurisdictional reforms\footnote{Obydenkova
(2011), p.3}. The expected gains from joint supranational actions would push
nation-states towards cooperation beyond the narrow field of collective
security. Political scientists like Haas, Lindberg, Scheingold and
Schmitter\footnote{see Haas (1961) \& (1964), Lindberg \& Scheingold (1970),
Schmitter (1969)}, for example, developed this concept further by arguing that
integration in one specific area engenders so-called \emph{'spill-over effects'}
which in turn initiate further integration in other fields. As incomplete
integration\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{In this paper the terms
\emph{integration} and \emph{Europeanization} will be used synonymously as the
integration process is exclusively happening in the European context}}
undermines the effectiveness of policy in already integrated area, pressure
builds up to deepen and extent international cooperation to new
sectors\footnote{Haas (1961), p.369}. This new school of though came to known as
\emph{Neo-Functionalism}.\par

\pagebreak 

	\subsection{Factors Shaping Regional Integration}

Regional integration processes are explained by Neo-Functionalists via the
interaction of three factors: 
  
  \textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item growing economic interdependence between countries
     \item capacity of supranational organization to resolve disputes and
establish international legal regimes
     \item international market rules that take the place of national market
rules
    \end{enumerate}
    }

The supply with natural gas from foreign sources is or may be conditioned
by the three factors mentioned above. European countries are highly reliant
on imported fossil fuels, for gas the share of imports stands at 67
\textdiscount{}, with Russia providing 24 \textdiscount{} of total EU gas
consumption\footnote{Eurogas (2012), p.6 \texttwelveudash{} figures are for
2011}. This dependence on foreign supplies is complicated by reliance on
transit countries not interfering with deliveries of natural gas via pipelines
running through their territory (For gas supplies from Russia, important
transit countries are Ukraine, Belarus and Poland among others). Since supplier
nations also rely on the revenues they receive via sales of natural gas to
Europe or transit fees, we have a situation of interdependence, the first
factor \emph{Neo-Functionalism} regards as essential for regional
integration\footnote{Goldthau (2012), p.67}.\par

The second and third factors, the capacity of international organizations to
resolve disputes between states over energy issues and establish as well as
enforce rules on the international energy market are basically two main topics
of analysis of the present research question. Integration of energy policy
describes the powers of EU institutions to set the rules of the 'energy game'
in Europe and constrain member states in their behavior towards foreign
suppliers and vis-\`{a}-vis each other. Initiated by interdependence between
single member states and foreign suppliers, Europeanization and more
specifically the growing importance of supranational institutions in this
field create a feed-back loop.\par

As mentioned above the first integration steps should act a drivers for further
Europeanization since their 'spill-over effects' will make the drawbacks and
inefficiencies of incomplete integration visible to national governments. I will
treat the later two \emph{Neo-Functionalist} factors primarily as eventual
results of the integration pressure caused by the first factor, using them as a
measure of the degree of Europeanization. Their role in driving the integration
process will be left aside due to the limited scope of this paper.\par
	
	


    \section{Liberal Intergovernmentalism}
	
	
Like \emph{Neo-Realism} the theory of \emph{Intergovernmentalism} approaches
the phenomenon of regional integration from the perspective of
nation-states\footnote{Obydenkova (2012), p.4}. States and their governments
are considered to be the primary actors in international politics and rational
in the pursuit of their interests. During major intergovernmental negotiations
results are neither driven by 'supranational policy entrepreneurs' like the
European Commission (\emph{Institutionalism}'s standpoint), the consequence of
'spill-over effects' (as \emph{Neo-Functionalism} maintains) or answers to
demands by powerful interest groups (argument made by
\emph{Liberalism})\footnote{Pollack (2001), p.226}.\par

Moravcsik, one of the leading proponents of \emph{(liberal)
Intergovernmentalism}, views EU negotiations as a cooperative game in which the
level of cooperation reflects patterns in the preferences of national
governments\footnote{Moravcsik (1997), p.499}. The course of the integration
process is determined by interstate bargaining. Outcomes of intergovernmental
conferences result from a gradual convergence of national preferences towards
integration. Departing from \emph{Neo-Realist} assumptions liberal
Intergovernmentalists argue that these preferences about international politics
are generated on the domestic level and are not solely derived from national
security considerations\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{This preference
formation on the domestic level with certain interest groups or individuals
involved gives this variant of \emph{Intergovernmentalism} the attribute
'liberal'.}}. Similarly, bargaining power is not only determined by military
strength and resources but rather by the intensity or salience of a country's
preferences\footnote{Moravcsik (1993), p.477}. Still Moravcsik admits that the
most powerful states in the EU determine the direction in intergovernmental
negotiations and treaties are concluded to their advantage\footnote{Moravcsik
(1997), p.502}.\par

As to why nation-states would transfer competences to the supranational level
\emph{Liberal Intergovernmentalism} offers an explanation somewhat analogous to
the one put forward by \emph{Functionalism}. The latter claimed that expected
gains from cooperative action would push national governments to joint
decision-making beyond questions of collective security. According to
\emph{Liberal Intergovernmentalism} binding international agreements and
supranational institutions are attractive alternatives to either unilateral
action or non-binding cooperative accords that could be affected by
issue-linkage\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{A negotiating strategy of
making agreement on one issue dependent on progress in negotiations about a
different issue. Combining multiple issues is used to change the balance of
interests in favor of a successful conclusion of an agreement.
\texttwelveudash{} Davis (2004), p.153}} during negotiations or the threat of
defection of one party from the obligations\footnote{Moravcsik (1995),
p.612}.\par

In contrast to \emph{Functionalism}'s standpoint, the \emph{liberal
Intergovernmentalist} approach assigns supranational institutions only a minor
role in the Europeanization process itself. They are mere instruments to reduce
transaction costs in interstate bargaining by providing member states with
information. \emph{Intergovernmentalists} deny the existence of political
'spill-over effects' when an organisation pushes for further integration out of
self-interest. In their perspective the European Commission, for example, cannot
be viewed as an 'activist bureaucracy' intent on being delegated ever larger
competences by member states\footnote{Pollack (2001), p.227}.

  \chapter{Energy Policy In The EU}
 
 
    \section{The Role Of Natural Gas For European Energy Consumption}


The European Union used 400.0 MTOE\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{The energy
unit \emph{Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (MTOE)} denotes the amount of energy
released by burning one tonne of crude oil. The precise calorific value of a
\emph{Tonne of Oil Equivalent} is defined by convention a different types of
crude oil have different calorific values. The IEA defines a TOE to have the
value of 41.868 GJ or 11.63 MWh (see IEA 2001). Applied to natural gas $1{}
m^{3}$ is the equivalent of $0.00093$ MTOE}} of natural gas in 2011. Out of a
total of 1704.1 MTOE of primary energy consumed\footnote{see Eurogas 2012} gas
thus has a 23 \textdiscount{} share in total primary energy use in the EU.
This makes it the secondest largest gas market in the world after North
America. Natural gas hasn't always played such a prominent role on European
energy markets. Not until the oil price shocks of 1973/1974 and 1979/1980 was
the potential of gas as a substitute for oil products recognized, especially in
the residential, commercial and industrial sectors\footnote{Institut f\"ur
Europ\"aische Politik (2013), p.8}. Three main uses may be distinguished for
natural gas:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)] \item fuel for heating space or water in the
residential and commercial sector, \item in industrial production gas is
utilized for heat generation, \item gas also serves as a fuel for electricity
generation even if it is of varying importance to different states depending on
the energ mix in electricity production.  
  \end{inparaenum} \par

Power generation is the most important \textcolor{orange}{use} for natural gas,
accounting for roughly a third of the total amount consumed\footnote{ibid
(2013), p.9}. New technology like the efficient Combined Cycle Gas Turbine
(CCGT) has made gas an attractive fuel for electricity generation. The
expansion of gas-powered electricity capacity amounted to approximately 120 GW
during the last decade, surpassing installation increases in any other
generation technology. Since gas turbines emit less $CO_{2}$ than coal-fired
power plants and are politically less controversial than nuclear plants, current
efforts to reduce carbon emissions will probably see an increase their share in
the energy mix. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects future
demand for natural gas as a primary energy source to rise as well its share
in electricity genereation to increase\footnote{see IEA (2012)}.\par


    \subsection{Disparities Among EU Member States}

The aggregate figures for the EU-27 as a whole conceal wide disparities in the
role natural gas plays for national consumption patters and the import
dependency. For the Netherlands the share of natural gas is the highest in the
EU with 44 \textdiscount{} of total primary energy use, followed by Lithuania
(36.5 \textdiscount{}), Romania (36 \textdiscount{}), Italy (35.2
\textdiscount{}) and the United Kingdom (34.5 \textdiscount{})\footnote{Eurogas
(2012), p.3 -- Figures for 2011}. At the other end of the spectrum we
find Slovenia (11 \textdiscount{}), Finland (9.5 \textdiscount{}), Estonia (9
\textdiscount{}) and Sweden with a share of 2.5 \textdiscount{}. As a reference
Germany, the largest member of the European Union (in terms of population and
size of its economy) uses gas for 20.5 \textdiscount{} of its primary energy
demand and for France the figure is 14 \textdiscount{}.\par


	\paragraph{High Import Dependency}

As domestic production is insufficient to cover demand, a large proportion of
the gas consumed has to be imported. In 2010 the share of imports from foreign
suppliers was 62.9 \textdiscount, up from 43.5 \textdiscount{} in
1995\footnote{Eurostat (2012), p.20}. In comparison, the import dependency for
coal and oil stood at 39.4 \textdiscount{} and 84.3 \textdiscount{}
respectively. Algeria, Norway, Russia and Qatar are the main foreign suppliers
of natural gas for Europe, of which Russia is the most important with a share of
24 \textdiscount{} of Europe's total consumption or 37 \textdiscount{} of
imports\footnote{Eurogas (2012), p.6 -- Figures for 2011}. Of the four
supplier countries mentioned only Norway can be considered as politically
reliable in so far as to have a stable, democratic political system and highly
unlikely to use disruptions of gas shipments as a tool of foreign policy as
Russia has repeatedly been accused of\footnote{see Belkin, Nichol, Ratner \&
Woehrel (2013)}. \par

Taking a closer look at individual member states the picture of import
dependency also varies widely: \textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{\emph{Please note that
the table shows reliance on Russian gas deliveries to satisfy domestic demand,
countries like Portugal and Spain are for their part completely dependent on
Algerian gas shipments}}\par

Without generalizing too much one can say that member countries from Central \&
Eastern Europe are on average more dependent on gas deliveries from Russia and
thus more vulnerable to supply disruptions on this route. During the the
repeated gas crises between Ukraine and Russia in the years from 2005 to
2010\footnote{Reuters (2009)} it was them who were the first to be affected by
the interruption of gas flows\footnote{BBC (2006), Le Devoir (2009)}. These
variations in reliance on foreign supplies are a first indicator as to why
member states embrace different strategies to ensure reliable provisions with
natural gas. Similarly a common European energy policy must look more or less
appealing to national governments depending on their specific supply situation.
 


    
    
    
    \section{The International Gas Market}

As of today there is no international gas market where prices are determined on
a spot market by balancing supply and demand analogous to the working of the
international oil market\footnote{Nies (2008), p.}. In fact
one can distinguish three distinct natural gas markets worldwide: East Asia,
North America and Europe which feature different gas prices\footnote{CIEP
(2004), p.61}. Since most of the gas shipments pass through pipelines, producers
and consumers are tied to this transport facilities. Substantial sunk costs
characterise energy infrastructure, so long-term supply contracts are the
norm, often with a duration of 20 years or more\footnote{BP (2012)}. Therefore
consumer countries cannot switch suppliers quickly, exposing them to risks
related to the producer side. Pipeline pose risks for producers as well, for
they equally cannot switch customers easily: pipelines are immobile
infrastructure with starting and end point predetermined for the duration of
their life.\par

An alternative to pipelines as mode of transport is 'Liquefied Natural Gas'
(LNG). Unfortunately this solution requires considerable investment into
liquifaction and gazification plants, with costs reaching several billion Euros.




    \section{Security Of Supply}

	
	\paragraph{What Does 'Security Of Supply' mean?}


The questions where European countries get their natural gas from and whether
these provision can be relied upon in the short- and long-term are captured by
the concept of '\emph{Security of Supply}'. There exist several definitions of
'Security of Supply'\footnote{Winzer (2011), p.4}, but nevertheless they all
share the same idea of avoiding sudden changes in availability of energy
relative to demand. Although this paper will not delve into the symantic
nuances between the various definitions, I shall present three different
versions: Winzer describes 'Supply Security' as "\textsl{the absence of, or
protection from or adaptibility to threats that are caused by or have an impact
on the energy supply chain}"\footnote{ibid (2011), p.9}. For the IEA
"\textsl{Energy Security is defined in terms of the physical availability of
supplies to satisfy demand at a given price}"\footnote{see IEA (2001)}.
Stefanova on the other hand explains the concept somewhat differently, but which
might be easier to grasp from a political science perspective: "\textsl{The
concept of energy security captures the entanglement of cost-benefit,
reliability, affordability, and sustainability concern in the provision of
natural gas}"\footnote{Stefanova (2012), p.52}.\par


	\paragraph{Unintentional Discontinuities}

Supply security can be jeopardized by different types of threats to the
constant flow of energy from producer to consumer country. The first
distinction which can be made here is between intentioned disruptions and
unintented discontinuities of natural gas supplies\footnote{Horsnell (2000),
p.11}. Natural catastrophes count among the unintended disruptions in case
transport infrastructure is so severely damaged as to put an effective halt to
further deliveries. The long-term effects of underinvestment in exploration and
development of new reserves or in transportation capacity will equally lead to a
shortfull in supplies. Arguably this can also be considered unintentioned in
nature for no single decision produces this outcome but rather it is the result
of a failed long-term investment strategy. Although the first threat to supply
security can occur suddenly, while the second make itself felt over a much
larger time horizon, supply diversification equally provides a hedge against
both risks.\par



	\paragraph{Intentioned Supply Disruptions}

Following Horsnell\footnote{see Horsnell (2000)} we can imagine two scenarios
where deliberate actions by the supplier's or consumer's side cause an
interruption in gas deliveries. Consumer countries could impose an embargo on
energy exports of a specific country. This might be done to exert pressure on
the producer country's government for a policy change, as several states have
decided to do in order to induce Iran to forgo its ambitions of a nuclear
weapons program. The prospects of EU members blocking Russian gas imports, so
as to push Moscow to alter its policy towards its neighbours say, or allow more
press freedoms or free speech in the domestic realm seems rather unlikely given
the aforementionend dependence on natural gas imports from Russia.\par

Finally gas supplies can be threatened in case the producer country either
decides to restrict its exports on short notice for political reasons or changes
its export strategy in general switching to different customers. Russia's
state-owned gas company \emph{Gazprom} seems to have embarked on such a
long-run strategy shift lately with attempts to make deals with China on natural
gas exports to East Asia rather than its traditional customers in
Europe\footnote{Bloomberg BusinessWeek (2012), Energy Tribune (2011), EurActiv
(2012), Reuters (2012)}. For the longer term this could pose serious problems
for Europe as it would stengthen Gazprom's negotiating position, then being able
to choose among different customers. Having alternative export routes for its
natural gas to East Asia at the same time reduces Gazprom's and thus the Russian
state's dependence on revenues from sales to European consumers. In effect this
would change substantially the current situation of interdependence in which
Europe and Russia are mutually dependent on each other: the one side counting on
reliable gas supplies to satisfy its energy demand, the other relying on
predictable income through long-term supply contracts. As in the disruption
scenarios mentioned above a diversification strategy away from an
over-reliance on natural gas imports would increase the European Union's
security of energy supplies.\par 




	\subsection{Security Of Supply For Europe}



Sudden interruptions of gas provision like the ones we have witnessed during the
disputes between Russia and Ukraine in the years 2005-2010 clearly put Europe's
supply security into question. Several EU members had been affected by
diminished gas deliveries although they were not party to the
disagreement\footnote{European Commission (2009), p.4}. The cases of
interrupted gas supplied causes by disagreements between producer and transit
countries falls into the threat category of 'intentioned supply disruption'.
Here is not the place to discuss the underlying reason for Russia to halt its
deliveries to Ukraine and thus eventually also to EU member states. For the
analysis at hand it suffices to state that this was a deliberate action for
whatever motive and can easilty happen again. The foremost interest of the
European Union is to reduce its vulnerability to such a supply shock,
addressing the fundamental causes of its occurence are relevant for Europe's
long-term energy strategy, immediate remedies have to look for different
solutions.\par

	  \paragraph{Diversification}

The previous section referred to \emph{diversification} as a way to improve
supply security. 'Diversification' is broad concept and encompasses several
steps to reduce one's vulnerability to sudden changes in the market
environment, the extreme case being a complete halt to energy deliveries. The
underlying idea is to avoid reliance on one energy source, type, technology or
means of transport to get the energy needed to end-customers\footnote{CIEP
(2004), p.2004}. First of all there is the possibility to receive one's energy
from a multitude of producer countries. As there would be several alternative
supplier available problems with shipments from one particular source should
have limited impact on the overall supply situation. Diversification can also be
applied to the type of energy, i.e. finding appropriate substitutes for the
energy type in use (e.g. substituting oil for gas or vice versa). A
discontinuity in gas provisions could thus be balanced by using more oil.
Particularly relevant for natural gas is a diversification of supply routes,
since here cooperation from the producer is not sufficient to ensure supply
security but the transit country's collaboration is necessaty as well.\par

Unfortunately the diversification potential for natural gas is considerably
less than for other types of energy\footnote{CIEP (2004), p.67}. As burning oil
and coal for electricity generations emits significantly higher amounts of
$CO_{2}$ using these types of primary energy as substitutes for gas is
politically undesirable taking into account the EU's climate change targets.
In addition, existing gas pipeline may not be used for oil shipments. So the
options of diversifying away from natural gas as a primary energy source for
heating and electricity production are very restricted.\par

Diversifying supply routes also poses its challenges: pipelines are physically
fixed, thus a switch to different transportation technology offers the only
viable option. LNG terminals would provide EU member states to receive gas from
other suppliers than their present ones, say Qatar, Nigeria, Egypt or
Venezuela. Even though LNG reliquification
plants\footnote{\textcolor{dunkelgrau.80}{Often overlooked in the debate on
security of natural gas supplies is the fact that seen globally the number of
liquification plants (Where natural gas is cooled down to about -162
\textcelsius{} have to roughly equal the number of regasification facilities.
Thus newly built regasification plants in Europe may face insufficient
liquification capacity in producer countries.)}} are expensive to
build\footnote{Nies (2008), p.47}.\par




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\chapter{EU Energy Policy Up To The Gas Crises Of The 2000s}



As mentioned in the introductory part until quite recently the scope of a
Europe's energy policy was rather limited when compared to other far more
integrated policy areas. Only since the adoption of the 'Lisbon Treaty' (Treaty
On The Functioning Of The European Community [TFEU]) on December 13, 2007,
was there a specific chapter on energy in the European
treaties\footnote{Braun (2011), p.1}.\par

The European Commission as the agenda setter for the EU legislative process was
thus very constrained in intitiating binding legislation that would have obliged
member states to adhere to common rules. It could only attempt to do so by
exercising so-called 'implicit powers', powers not granted in the (numerously
amended) foundation documents, to have joint measures adopted for which there is
no express treaty basis\footnote{Haghighi (2008), p.464}. Specifically articles
95, 100 and 308 of the European Community Treaty [ECT] (now the Treaty on the
European Union [TEU]) provided the European Commission with opportunities to
expand the remit of EU law into new areas.\par
 
Still measures related to energy questions had to be adopted by consensus when
submitted to the Council of Ministers\footnote{\textcolor{red}{CITATION
NEEDED!!!!}}, giving essentially every member country a veto against decisions
perceived as harmful to its interests. Here the Commission's effort to
'integrate' energy policy and create an EU-wide market for energy alongside
common rules for all have often been rejected by national
governments\footnote{\textcolor{red}{CITATION NEEDED!!!!}}.\par

In its Green Papers on energy (2000 \& 2006) for example\footnote{European
Commission (2000), ibid (2006)} the European Commission had proposed the
creation of strategic gas reserves available to all EU members in case of a
crisis. The idea was dropped when it encountered considerable resistance in the
Council\footnote{CIEP (2004), p.68}. The benefits of such a costly measure would
have been unequally distributed since the import dependence for natural gas
varies considerably among the different countries as shown in the section
\textbf{4.1.1}. Since gas can only be stored in strategic reserves given certain
geological conditions, which are not present in all European countries, the
proposed measure would also have required establishing an integrated European
gas network for the reserves to be effective in an emergency situation. That not
only involves sufficient investment funds but also mutual trust among members to
act in the common interest. This example highlights the collective action
problem posed by a European energy policy, when a joint response is warranted
but the cooperation of other members is still perceived as uncertain. At the
same time the issue of supply security was not deemed as pressing enough for
Europeans to transfer powers to Union institutions and establish oversight
mechanisms for enforcing compliance.\par

Generally speaking national governments have preferred to pursue individual
energy strategies, instead of pooling resources or even delegating competences
to EU institutions to control whether everyone adheres to the commonly agreed
strategy. Member states have backed their major energy firms by securing them
political support for business activities abroad on a bilateral basis,
especially when government are important\footnote{Pointvogel (2009), p.5709}.
The same is true for the internal market, where governments intervened in order
to delay liberalisation efforts by the Commission to shield their energy
companies from foreign competition.\par

\chapter{Ukrainian-Russian Disputes Over Natural Gas As An External Shock}

I will provide a very short chronology on the gas crises between 2005 and 2011
that lead to repeated interruptions of gas deliveries from Russia to Ukraine.
Ukraine being the main transit country for shipment to Central \& Eastern
Europe these events in turn  resulted in supply disturbences for several EU
member states. The underlying causes of the gas disputes and the political
motives of the principal actors Ukraine and Russia, if there were any, will not
be subject of this paper. The reader is advised to see the references provided
for further information.

    \section{Dispute 2005 -- 2006}


\begin{itemize}
	
\item Disagreement between Ukrainian gas firm \emph{Naftogaz} and
Russia's \emph{Gazprom} about gas supplies, prices, debt incurred by the
Ukrainian side\footnote{for a detailed account of the events see Stern (2006)}

  \begin{itemize}
   \item Gazprom demanded market prices for natural gas deliveries which had
been subsidized in the years since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1992

   \item The Russians also claimed that Ukraine was siphoning off gas intended
for customers in the European Union\footnote{Gelb, Nichol \& Woehrel (2006),
p.2}. 

   \item No final agreement was reached during 2005.

  \end{itemize}


\item Russian gas shipment were cut off on January 1st, 2006


\item While Germany's and France's gas supplies remained virtually unaffected,
Poland saw its provisions from Ukraine/Russia decline by 14\textdiscount{} and
Hungary's imports were down by a quarter\footnote{BBC (2006)}

\item Then EU commissioner for energy Andris Piebalgs stated in a speech that
security of supply was an important issue for the EU and that a
``\textsl{clearer and more collective and cohesive policy on energy supply}''
was needed\footnote{see: Piebalgs (2006)}.
	


	\end{itemize}


    \section{Dispute 2007 -- 2008}

\begin{itemize}


\item Gazprom threatened to interrupt gas supplies to Ukraine if debt of
\textdollar 1.3 billion remained unpaid on October 2nd, 2007

\item On 5 January 2008 another warning to reduce the supply of natural gas was
issued if arrears of \textdollar 1.5 billion were not settled.

\item At the end of February 2008 Gazprom threatened to halt deliveries from 3 
March on, in case gas shipments for 2008 were not paid in advance\footnote{BBC
(2008)}.

\item Supplies to Ukraine were reduced by 25\textdiscount{} on March 3rd and a
further 25\textdiscount{} the day after.



\end{itemize}


    \section{Dispute 2008 -- 2009}


\begin{itemize}

\item Several disputes between Ukrainian and Russian gas/transit companies
about prices and contract terms over the year 2008 saw Gazprom warning in
December 2009 that failure to reach an agreement for supplies in 2009 would
result in higher gas prices and eventually disruptions of supplies to Europe.

  \begin{itemize}
   \item Not only gas prices for 2009 were a point of contention, but also
outstanding debt by Naftogaz\footnote{Le Figaro (2009)}
  \end{itemize}

\item Starting from 4 January 2009 gas flows from Russia to Ukraine began
falling and stopped completely on January 7th\footnote{Le Devoir (2009)}

\item On 8 January 2009 the Czech presidency of the European Council released a
statement in which both Russia and Ukraine were criticised for lacking will to
resolve their differences. In addition, the declaration demanded that both
parties accept an independent mission monitoring the flow of
gas\footnote{see: Czech Presidency of the Council of the EU (2009)}.

\item After German chancellor Angela Merkel had talked with Russian prime
minister Vladimir Putin, the European Commission started negotiations with
representatives from Gazprom and Russian state officials to set up a monitoring
agreement including Ukraine.

\item All three parties, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union signed an
accord on an independent monitoring mission on 12 January,
2009\footnote{see: Pirani, Stern \& Yafimava (2009)} 

\item The effects on gas supplies for EU member were considerable: Bulgaria,
Slovakia, Greece, Austria and the Czeck Republic experienced drops in gas flows
of more than 65\textdiscount{}. For the first time big member states were
affected by the cutoff: Germany (10\textdiscount{}), Italy (25\textdiscount{}),
France (15\textdiscount{})
